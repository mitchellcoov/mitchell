        I have always enjoyed doing puzzles and one of my favourites has always been Sudoku. If you've looked at my other projects you might have seen that I've made a Sudoku game before for a <a href="mcmaster-projects">school project</a> while I was in university. I&apos;ve always wanted to revisit and improve on it. Though this new version still isn't perfect, it is a huge improvement over the original. This version is a web application written with TypeScript and React, instead of a Java application.

        The game board is generated randomly each game. It first goes through and generates the full board. It will then recursively eliminate one square at a time and use backtracking to solve the board and ensure that there is only a single solution. To learn more about the algorithm used please see backtracking on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>. It will also keep track of moves allowing the player to undo. 

        The game allows users to select the level of difficulty they would like to play. The random generation does make it difficult to judge a game's difficulty because the types of moves required to solve are unknown. So difficulty is adjusted by the number of tiles eliminated. The alternative would be to store a set of known puzzles with their difficulties but I found the solving algorithm to be a more interesting project than using pregenerated boards.

        This might be the project I'm most proud of from a design/aesthetic point of view. I wanted to keep the look simple and light, and not crowd the page. I think the colour palette could be improved a bit but for now it's good.

        For the future, I think adding a hint button and different types of boards would be interesting but we'll see.
