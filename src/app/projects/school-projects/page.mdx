        ##### Self-Driving Car
        For my capstone project in my final year of university I was part of a team that worked on self-driving capabilities. The capstone was part of collaboration between the university and an automotive company. The collaboration afforded us some benefits, such as the cars that we were working with, and the figure eight track that the cars were to drive on. The car was fitted with a camera, and a raspberry pi, to navigate. Our task was to get the car to traverse the track and to stop at the middle intersection. We were able to build off of a previous team's work. The code we wrote was a mixture of C++ and Python. We were able to get the car to move and turn, but we weren&apos;t able to get the car to take the camera input and turn it into reliable movement. In all, it was an interesting project but we didn&apos;t get the result we set out for from the beginning.

        ##### Sudoku
        This was a single term class project, that I worked on with two classmates. We created a sudoku game. It was written in Java and used the Swing library for the GUI. It had a randomly generated board that was always solveable, it had multiple backgrounds and different music for each one. At the time of creating it I was super proud of the work we did and though I am proud now, if I made it again I would definitely take a different approach. It was quite a maximalist take on sudoku, adding more features than it needed, just for the sake of doing it. Something that I wasn&apos;t aware of at the time of making it, is that there should only be one unique solution to every puzzle.
