        This has been a little passion project of mine. I try my best to keep myself informed on what is happening in both my country, Canada, as well my province, Ontario. Finances is always a topic of discussion when it comes to which party should be governing at any given time. So i wanted to have an intuitive and easy to use view of Ontario&apos;s financial history. I couldn&apos;t find an existing one, so I made it myself.

        The current frontend was created using React, NextJS, TailWindCSS, and <a class="" href="https://recharts.org/en-US" target="_blank">Recharts</a> for the chart components. The backend is Java Spring Boot application, connected to a MongoDB that contains all of the data. My first attempt was using Material UI for some components and the charts but I found that the charts were not as customizable as I needed. The backend was also made using NodeJS and Express but I found that switching it over to Java was easier for me due to familiarity even though I don&apos;t think Java is the best suited for what I&apos;m doing. 

        The hardest part of this project was trying to figure out how I wanted to architect it. At first I was thinking of using a relational db because one might think that the reports would be similiar year to year, but unfortunately they aren&apos;t. So that pretty quickly went out the window and I moved on to a NoSQL db, and chose MongoDB. I&apos;d never used Mongo before and thought I might as well give it a try. It was pretty easy to setup and get going. My biggest slow down with it was deciding how to setup my collections. I settled on grouping the data into collections by the schedule in which they&apos;re found in the reports. For example, schedule 1 is revenue by source, and is broken down into taxation, transfers from the government of Canada, etc. 



        The entire site is running on Docker images coordinated with Docker Compose. It&apos;s simple and easy to manage for this project. 

        I will continue to add to this project as I find the time again as there are a number of things I&apos;d still like to add to it. The accessibility isn&apos;t where I would like it to be, I need to make sure it is usable by everyone. The responsiveness is improved from when I started but it could always be better. I&apos;ll open up the code on GitHub once I feel more comfortable with the state it&apos;s in. If you live in Ontario I encourage you to go check it out and see our governments spending patterns.
