I first created my own personal site while I was in university, mitchellcoovert.com. I used it as a way to try to highlight some of my skills. I had no design experience (I still don't have much) so I used a design I found on a designs website, as my layout. I made it with Angular, but I didn&apos;t like it very much (I still don&apos;t). I eventually let the certificates expire and then just took it down. I didn&apos;t feel like it was serving a purpose anymore. I also had a contact me form that was constantly being spammed.

For the second iteration I moved to the coovert.ca domain. I feel like the URL looks cleaner and it allows my wife and I to share the same domain but each have our own subdomains. Since, I didn&apos;t have any of the code from the first site I started from scratch again. I doubt I would have used anything anyway. I made the choice to go with React this time. For me, it has been stellar! I find it super easy to use and intuitive. I&apos;m also using TypeScript instead of JavaScript because I prefer a statically typed language to a dynamically typed one. NextJS is the routing framework underneath, I can&apos;t speak to it a lot but I don't have any qualms with it. And lastly TailwindCSS for inline styling. Which I think is good but not great.

This is currently the third rendition of this site and all that was changed from the previous version is style and layout. Looking at the second version I thought it was a little too boring. I want simple design because I'm not an overly flashy person but not that simple and at some points it lacked cohesion. I liked the colour palette that I chose and wanted to stick with it, fleshing it out a little more and I think this is an improvement.<img class="right project-picture" src="/projects/this-site/coovert_ca_screenshot.png" alt="The mitchell.coovert.ca previous homepage" width="300"> I&apos;ve also eliminated the coovert.ca page because it felt unneccessary. If someone is looking for one of us, I imagine they are already at one of our homepages and not going from coovert.ca. The projects page got a pretty substantial overhaul in it's writing because of the fact I split up each project into it&apos;s own page instead of having them all together on one single page.
