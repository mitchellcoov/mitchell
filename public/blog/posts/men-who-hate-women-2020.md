 As a person who identifies as a man I can't help but feel overwhelming angry. I feel sad. And I just feel gross. As a society we need to abandon this idea of masculinity, of gender roles, and stereotypes. We need to stop placing ourselves in boxes determined by what may or may not be between our legs. 
 
 This is a into the destructive power that toxic masculinity has.

Most of the men in this described in this book are so depressed and upset but in no way does it excuse them. It does however put some blame on our society, on our lack of mental health support. On the people who harness, or profit off of their anger. We are fed an image of what men MUST be otherwise we are weak.
