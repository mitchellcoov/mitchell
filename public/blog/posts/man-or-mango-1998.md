*Man or Mango?* is the story of two subjectively bad, lonely people searching for love. Those bad people being Elo&iuml;se and George. 

I'm going to come right out of the gate and say I *loved* this book. I don't think it's everyone's cup of tea but it is very much mine. It's kind of like, if a Wes Anderson film were a novel.  

Every character is written in a way that fully captures each of their unique personalities. Elo&iuml;se is a introverted, sex obsessed, Scotswoman . George a brash, **angry** American.
