&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I am a **sucker** for murder mystery books. I love being shown what is akin to a magic trick and trying to piece it together, clue by clue, until the trick is revealed in the end. My favourite thing about magic tricks, is not the illusion itself, but knowing how it was performed. Anthony Horowitz is a darn fine magician, he does murder mystery so very well. *The Word is Murder* is the second novel I've read by him, the first being *Magpie Murders*, which was also very well done. I will be reading more in the future.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*The Word is Murder* is a pretty traditional murder mystery when it comes to format. It begins like a lot of murder mysteries with the our victim's introduction and subsequent murder. All of the suspects are then interviewed. Another character is murdered. We are lulled into believing that we know the killer and then the story takes a 180&deg; turn. Pretty standard stuff I would say. This time though, the victim, Diana, was introduced while she was planning her own funeral. I was immediately invested. *Why* was she planning her funeral the day she was murdered? Did she know or was it a coincidence to lead the reader astray?


&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It then becomes even more intriguing when we learn that the narrarator is the author himself, Anthony Horowitz. It seems Anthony likes taking a bit of a meta approach in his novels. *Magpie Murders* was also meta in that it was, for the most part, a novel inside of another novel. I think it's helping to keep the medium a little more fresh and exciting. There is no shortage of murder myseries out there and so any little twist you can put on it to make it even a little more exciting is good.
